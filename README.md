# TroubleInBoneTown
Source code for my BONELAB: Fusion gamemode! <br>
Use this as a resource to learn how to do certain things in both the Fusion gamemode API and my extended gamemode API!

Trouble in Bonetown is a remake of the classic TTT gamemode from Garry's mod! Includes stuff like persistent ragdolls, 
spectator mode, wrist UI, and dead body inspection! Basically everything except the buy menu.
